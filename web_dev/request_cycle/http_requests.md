A cookie is a small text file sent from a website that  stores data in the browser of the user's machine....it allows the data/text file to be used with each subsequent request on that same website. An example would be login information... once you have logged into a site, you can navigate to other tabs of that site without relogging in by setting a cookie with that data.
