# Strategies for studying jQuery

My JavaScript & jQuery book by Jon Duckett was really effective for getting the basics of jQuery and seeing examples. The book is not too dense and gives nice images of different file types (html, js file, jquery file) to show how they all work in tandem and how elements are selected.

Seeing examples on the w3schools.com tutorials was very helpful. With the "Try it Yourself" tab, I'm able to change things and see what changes with code that is already working, which is nice.
